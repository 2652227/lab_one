                Hi there I am formerly known as Makomane Tau, my family calls me Pontsho, and my friends call me Toure, you can call me by whichever you are comfortable with.
                I study Computer Science at the University of the Witwatersrand... which i think is the only the interesting thing i have going on right now.
                I have this saying, "My future is too bright for me to lose", I know i have a purpose on this earth and I will live up to it, 
                watch the space because I am about to make it small. 
            </p>

                Latest Project
            </h3>
            <p>
                The reason why i found this lab easy is beacuse for the whole of last year i have been working on an Ecommerce website for my brother's clothing store.
                Obviously I still have a lot to learn from my lecturer, seeing as how he is changing my whole coding style for websites. But at the end of the day
                that website is my proudest acheivement even though it has been launched yet, but nonetheless it is mine and will forever be my baby.
